# The Code Snippets Company

Welcome to The Code Snippets Company GitHub profile! We are an initiative founded by Shea Bunge (Chief Code Crusher) and Verdi Heinz (Chief Pixel Pusher). While our expertise may differ, our mission is the same: **Enabling Web Creators to customize their websites safely, easily, with fewer plugins, and without the need for Child Themes.**

## WordPress Origin Story

Our journey began back in June 2012, when Shea Bunge created a small plugin designed to make it easier to inject code into `functions.php`. This plugin saved countless hours by eliminating the need to use an FTP client and reducing the chances of human error. Over the years, the plugin continued to evolve, gathering a large and loyal following.

By 2017, the plugin was running on over 100,000 websites, helping users eliminate the need for Child Themes and avoiding the common pitfalls associated with using too many small plugins. Code Snippets became widely recognized, with theme makers, plugin creators, and hosting companies recommending it and even including their own snippets to solve problems or provide useful customizations.

Around this time, Verdi Heinz recognized the potential of Code Snippets and reached out to Shea via GitHub. Verdi had ideas for expanding the plugin's functionality, and as it turned out, these ideas had been on Shea's mind for some time. However, the possibility of creating a Pro version had never been seriously considered‚Äîno Pro meant no funding, and no funding meant no development. But Verdi believed in the vision and decided to fund the project privately, leading to the formation of a partnership.

Together, we worked on new formats and functions for the Pro version. Beyond that, we envisioned a new social platform where users could share and rate snippets, fostering a community of web creators helping each other save time and achieve more with fewer plugins.

## The Code Snippets Pro Era

In 2019, The Code Snippets Pro company was officially founded. Shea focuses on coding, while Verdi handles design and the business side of things. Our shared mission remains clear and singular: **To empower Web Creators to customize their websites safely and easily, without the need for Child Themes and with fewer plugins.**
